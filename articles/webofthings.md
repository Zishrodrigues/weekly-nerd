## The house of tomorrow

*“Using these simple boards you can prototype and create interactive, exciting experiences which truly have the potential to change the way we live and interact with the world around us.”*

### Web of things

Soft and relaxing guitar music starts playing in the background. The ambient lights in your living room slowly come alive. The oven starts preheating. You hang your coat, it was a long day and you’re tired. As you walk into the kitchen the refrigerator door opens, you get out food and put it in the oven. You walk to the living room, the tv starts and the guitar music fades out. You sit down on the couch and a bottle of ice cooled beer slides down from a tube in the wall right into your hand. Your feet land on the table and you take a sip. Time to lay back and relax.

### Easy living

This is what Internet of things can bring us. A world that’s connected to you and the internet. Small things that are usually a drag can be automated, or made fun again. Niels showed us the steps he’s been taking to automate his house. His chicken water heats up automatically based on the weather. He gets a signal whenever there’s mail and he knows the status of his washing machine. Are these things a must? No. But they can make life easier and inspire you to let go and be creative. All those things that were once sci-fi can become a reality with a few simple tools and skillsets.

### Everyone can do it

Arduino and NodeMCU changed a lot for Internet of things. Using these simple boards you can prototype and create interactive, exciting experiences which truly have the potential to change the way we live and interact with the world around us. Safety can be an issues; A lot of cheaper IoT devices don’t have a secured connection and the last thing you want is someone being able to open the door to your house. But this shouldn’t scare you off from experimenting with IoT. So what if someone takes the effort to hack your desk lamp and change the color to purple? That’s not the worse that can happen. Just be aware of what you use IoT for.

### conclusion

‘The house of the future’ really isn’t an impossible of unrealistic idea anymore. We can dream up concepts and ideas for our automated house and then build prototypes of these ideas using tools like Arduino and NodeMCU. As cliché as it may sound, your imagination truly is the limit. So the next time you come up with a coffee machine that starts brewing as soon as you get out of bed; write it down, order a NodeMCU and a pressure sensor.. and start building!
