# Article: A limitless tool belt

*Inspired by the talk Peter Paul Koch gave on browser features and tools*

## Thinking on paper

*“We’re digging to find some type of treasure, we keep digging and if we forgot to look up.. we might have dug ourselves too deep.”*

### The repairman

‘Ding!’. The doorbell rings. A week ago you called the repairman because the air conditioner broke down in the middle of June. Lately your house has been feeling like a life size walk-in oven. ‘Morning!’ the repair man happily says as you open the door. His confident eyes piercing and his tool belt fastened. Fast forward 40 minutes and your living rooms feels as cool as an autumn morning. ‘Anything else I can do for you while I’m here?’. You think, and suddenly remember that one of your sunscreens has stopped working two days ago. ‘Actually, yeah. The sunscreen doesn’t go down anything. Care to take a look at it?’. After investigating the problem for a few minutes the repair man walks up to you and says ‘No can do, I’m afraid. Haven’t got the right tools. I need a T757 screwdriver for this one, which is back at headquarters’.

### Limitess

And that’s the power of us as a developer. Our tool belts are limitless. For each problem there’s a potential solutions, usually multiple solutions. In fact, there are so many tools and solutions that we don’t even know about  a lot of them. And that’s the point Peter Paul Koch was making during his talk. Yeah, we’ve got tons of tools to develop with. Our browsers are adding new features by the week. But the question is; is this necessarily a good thing?

### Many new tools

Today web apps are doing their best to keep up with native apps. While there’s always a slight difference in speed and possibility; browsers keep adding new features so we as web developer remain competitive to native developers. This however, creates a situation in which a lot of features are missed by the mainstream development community or just plainly left by the wayside. With so many new tools our development areas get bigger and deeper, which makes debugging harder for yourself and other developers. We’re digging to find some type of treasure, we keep digging and if we forgot to look up.. we might have dug ourselves too deep.

### conclusion

So.. what is the solution? One of the more extreme solutions could be to just stop adding features for a while. Learn and work with what we have until we perfected it. But that’s a pretty bold idea. Another though is to accept that the web is different on all kinds of devices and context. And instead of viewing this as a bad thing we can view it as a good thing; a strength. Maybe if we stop trying to make web apps look and behave like native apps, we can embrace it’s power of flexibility and work on making smaller, friendlier tools. I’ll get right to that after checking out the sweet new Angular 4 release.
