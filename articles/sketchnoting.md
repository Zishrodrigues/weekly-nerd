## Thinking on paper

*“But that’s the beauty of sketch noting; there is no wrong. You are the audience. You are free and with each pen stroke you have the power to do anything.”*

### Letting yourself go

Sketch noting is the idea that instead of using only words and sentences to takes notes, you use icons, drawings and words. Some people might think ‘That sounds pretentious..’ or ‘Too difficult and not efficient’. These people usually draw these conclusions without actually trying it. Sketch noting is about letting yourself go. It’s about being free. Free to take in information, free to remember information and most importantly; free to express yourself to yourself. Let’s imagine two different scenarios where you’re at a conference in which you’ll be taking notes.

### Scenario one; traditional writing

You’re at a conference. The day is filled with interesting speakers giving talks on a range of subjects. At each talk you furiously write down the important points and do your best to not fall behind. At the end of the day you’re feeling great because you’ve practically written a book that’s filled with great advice, tips and sources. Fast forward a few weeks. You’re facing a UX problem. Suddenly you remember you heard a great talk on UX a few weeks before at the conference. You grab your notebook and start turning pages. Each page looks the same; text. You’re having a hard time finding specific subjects let alone a single piece of advice. It’s not an enjoyable or fun experience to look through the notes you made.

### Scenario two; Sketch noting

You’re at a conference. The day is filled with interesting speakers giving talks on a range of subjects.
At each talk you casually write down words, connect them with clouds and sketch down your thoughts. You’re listening and fully focused on the speaker while you let your pen dance on the paper. At the end of the conference you’re feeling happy, you’ve got a nice book full of sketch notes. Fast forward a few weeks. You’re facing a UX problem, suddenly you remember you’ve heard a great talk on UX a few weeks before at the conference. You grab your sketch noting book and start browsing. You smile. A lot of the quick drawings are amusing, and they’re all telling. With a quick glance of the page you know exactly what the talk was about and more importantly; what you took from it. Before you know it you found what you were looking for as well as remember a lot of other stuff.

### conclusion

This is the essence of what Eva-lotta lamm was saying in her talk. Sketch noting isn’t about doing the thing that’s ‘hip’ at the moment, nor is it a way to try and be more creative. It’s merely about having a deep and profound connection with your own subconscious. You draw what you think, you draw what you feel. And with time, you’ll be able to reflect upon your own sketch notes and your current self will be communicating with your past self through your drawings and words. A lot of people fear the idea of sketching. They’re afraid that they aren’t good enough to draw. But that’s the beauty of sketch noting; there is no wrong. You are the audience. You are free and with each pen stroke you have the power to do anything. So the next time you’re thinking about taking written notes at a conference; let yourself go and try sketching. Who knows, maybe your future self will thank you.
