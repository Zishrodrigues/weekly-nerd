# Article: The web is for everyone

*Inspired by the talk Bram Duvigneau gave on accessibility*

## The web is for everyone

*“While I was excited and ready for the talk; nothing could prepare me for it. That day fundamentally changed the way I look at the web, my career and the world.”*

### Not sure what to expect

When I heard one of our speakers for the Weekly nerd would be a ‘blind developer’ I wasn’t sure what to expect. I was certainly intrigued and curious as to how Bram worked and what he’d have to tell us. But I didn’t have a clear picture on what it means to browse and work with the internet without being able to see. Sure, I’ve tabbed through pages and used screen readers before while testing. But for a limited time and in a controlled environment. While I was excited and ready for the talk; nothing could prepare me for it. That day fundamentally changed the way I look at the web, my career and the world.

### Inspiring

It was around 4pm and we we’re waiting for the talk to begin. A guy walked in with his black dog. As the dog took to resting under the desk, Bram started setting up his equipment. He has a windows laptop and a special kind of keyboard. One which allowed him to feel text on the screen with a number of pins that pop in and out. A braille keyboard. It was the first time I saw anything like it, and before the talk even started I was already impressed by the way Bram set up his work station.

### Semantic HTML

When the presentation started Bram took us through the HvA website and showed us what it was like to browse the web without seeing, and what kind of problems he encountered on a daily basis. Headings are a crucial part of good usability. The right headings can tell a user exactly what the page is about and where to find important and relevant information. Using heading levels is also extremely important as it tells the screen reader which headings to focus on first. Using the correct element in HTML is a must. If something is a link, us a <a> tag. If something is clickable, use a button. When you use a div as a button it doesn’t actually tell the screen reader anything. It’s just a div without context. Don’t force users into your own preferences. Using absolute sizes like pixels is asking for trouble. Use Em’s and percentages so the user can scale the font size if they have a hard time seeing.

### conclusion

After the talk was over I just sat there for a bit. Lost in thought, inspired. Here was a blind developer that not only had more knowledge about the web and it’s inner workings than I did, he browsed and read a website faster and more accurate than I ever could. This truly made me realize what Vasilis has always been telling us; the web is for everyone. And not only can everyone use the web, they can all use it equally efficiently and in their own way. As a web developer it is my responsibility to make sure it stays this way. I can create website and apps that are open and accessible to everyone. And I can inspire others to do so too.
